### Hai, Hai... 
Welcome to my github ðŸ’«

My life motto is to keep things as simple as possible. 

I primarily work with Python, and occasionally, I write code in Java (If im in the mood). Currently, my interest in machine learning and computer vision because my passion is to apply mathematical formulas in programming.

I have experience in web development using CodeIgniter and Bootstrap, with PHP and CSS. 

Additionally, I can program with Arduino and QBasic.
