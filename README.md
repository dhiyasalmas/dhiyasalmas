### Haiii, Haii... 
Welcome to my github ðŸ’«

My life motto is to keep things simple as possible. 

I primarily work with Python, but sometimes, I write code in Java (If im in the mood). Currently, my interest in machine learning and computer vision because i liked to apply mathematical equations in programming.
But recently, I have been interested in implementing nuclear equations in programming. I have experience to made programme to calculate cogeneration system and thermal hydraulic on HTGR.

Just for fun, i try to learn in web development using CodeIgniter and Bootstrap, with PHP and CSS. 

Additionally, I can program with Arduino and QBasic.
